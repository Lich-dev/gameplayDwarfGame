Gameplay Simulation Algorithm
- contains the algorithms used for deisigning and simulating the gameplay design
- code also generates data for visual graphs made in Excel
- the output file is manually coded to export the data file into E:\UHKREMOTE\, you should change this directory to your preference if you wish to generate your own data (latest export is included in the graphs folder)
- upon launching the code, a debug window showing generated values for gameplay design, pressing 'enter' will close it and generate the data file

Graphs and Data
- contains the latest generated datasheet from the simulation algorithm
- also contains a sheet of static values and a sheet containing graphs for a better visualization of the game's progression (you will be required to open the datasheet first in order to update the graphs' data)

Compiled Game
- located in releases

list of bug fixes:
- prestige button hitbox fixed
- options button positioning fixed

All custom code was written by Rejman David
Art is done by Rejman David - @PowerLichie, @LillyAlbarn and @pakokako_ on X.com

This project was made as an experiment and serves the purpose of a practical example in a Bachelor's thesis about gameplay design for UHK.
